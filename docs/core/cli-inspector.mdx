The `zon-inspector` is a terminal tool indispensable for debugging. Since ZON is binary, you cannot open it in Notepad.

## Commands

<ParamField body="zon-inspector <FILE>" type="command">
  Dumps the structure of the given `.zon` file to stdout.
</ParamField>

## Reading the Output

```text
[HEADER] Magic: ZON1 | Size: 48 bytes
[0x00] String: "Hero"
[0x10] Root Offset -> pointing to 0x00
```

1.  **Header Check**: Verifies the file starts with `ZON1`.
2.  **Objects**: Decodes strings and known structures.
3.  **Pointers**: Visualizes where offsets point to (e.g., `-> 0x00`).
