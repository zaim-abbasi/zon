## Prerequisites

ZON is built for the Rust and Node.js ecosystems. Ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Rust**: v1.70 or higher (for `zon-lib`)
*   **Node.js**: v18 or higher (for `@zon-lib/zon`)

<CodeGroup>

```bash Rust (Cargo)
# 1. Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# 2. Add ZON to your project
cargo add zon-lib
```

```bash Node.js (NPM)
# Install the WASM Bridge
npm install @zon-lib/zon
```

```bash CLI Tool
# Install the Inspector globally
cargo install zon-inspector
```

</CodeGroup>

## Verification

Verify your installation by checking the version of the `zon-inspector`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run Version Check">
    Execute the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    zon-inspector --version
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Output">
    You should see an output similar to:
    ```text
    zon-inspector 0.1.0
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have the tools installed, let's write your first ZON file.
