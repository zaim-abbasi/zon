In this guide, we will simulate a real-world scenario:
1.  **Rust Service**: Generates a high-performance binary file (`data.zon`).
2.  **Node.js Service**: Reads the file instantly without parsing.

## 1. Rust Writer (The Producer)

Create a new Rust file (e.g., `producer.rs`) to generate the data.

```rust producer.rs
use zon_lib::{ZonWriter, ZonReader};
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // 1. Initialize the Zero-Copy Writer
    let mut writer = ZonWriter::new();
    
    // 2. Write Data
    // Strings and numbers are written to the buffer, returning offsets.
    let name_offset = writer.write_string("PlayerOne");
    let score_offset = writer.write_u32(9999);
    
    // 3. Set Root
    // The "Root" is the entry point of your file. Here, we point to the name.
    writer.set_root(name_offset);
    
    // 4. Save to Disk
    let mut file = File::create("data.zon")?;
    file.write_all(writer.as_bytes())?;
    
    println!("Successfully wrote data.zon");
    Ok(())
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Why Offsets?** ZON doesn't store data in a JSON tree. It stores data linearly and uses 32-bit offsets (pointers) to link them. This allows O(1) jump access.
</Callout>

## 2. Node.js Reader (The Consumer)

Now, let's read that file in Node.js using the WASM bridge.

```javascript consumer.js
const fs = require('fs');
const { ZonReaderWasm } = require('@zaim-abbasi/zon-wasm');

// 1. Read the binary file into memory
const buffer = fs.readFileSync('data.zon');

// 2. Initialize the WASM Reader
// This wraps the buffer without copying it.
const reader = new ZonReaderWasm(buffer);

// 3. Get the Root Offset
// This matches the 'set_root' call in Rust.
const root = reader.get_root();

// 4. Read Data
// We know the root points to a string, so we read it as a string.
console.log("Player Name:", reader.read_string(root)); 
// Output: Player Name: PlayerOne
```

## 3. Visualize with Inspector

You can also verify the file structure without writing code:

```bash
zon-inspector data.zon
```

**Output:**
```text
[HEADER] Magic: ZON1 | Size: ...
[offset] String: "PlayerOne"
```
